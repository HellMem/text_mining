Everyone tells Zanele that numbers are all around her. But no matter how hard she tries, she can�t see them. Zanele asks Gogo to help her see some numbers. Gogo points to the jars on the shelf and counts, �one, two, three, four.� But Zanele is unhappy. �Those aren�t numbers. Those are jars!.� Zanele asks Mom to help her see some numbers. Mom points to the carrots in the garden and counts, �one, two, three, four.�
But Zanele is unhappy. �Those aren�t numbers. Those are carrots!� Zanele sees Linda counting the chickens, to see if they have all come back home.
But Zanele is unhappy. �Those aren�t numbers. Those are chickens!� Zanele sees Auntie counting the hours until supper.
But Zanele is unhappy. �Those aren�t numbers. Those are hours!� Zanele can�t see the numbers in the world.
She goes to speak to her sister, Gugu, who is eight years old and knows everything. �If you look at anything in the right way, you can see a number in it,� says Gugu.
Gugu gives Zanele a pair of magic glasses and tells her to go look for numbers in the world.
